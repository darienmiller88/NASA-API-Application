Web Application to extract data from the NASA API and display them on dynamically on an HTML file! Written using the "Gin" web framework. View it at https://nasa-apod-application.herokuapp.com/


   ## Installation

Assuming Golang is already installed, run the command ```go get -u github.com/gin-gonic/gin``` in the root of your project directory. Click [here](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) to read more on the web framework I used for this project. 

Afterwards, clone the project onto your platform using ```git clone myrepo ```
Run ``` go run main.go ``` and visit port 8080 to see the app running!
